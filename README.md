  The Director's Page

## Introduction
`Vidlium` is a simply powerful tool to bring in remote guests into software like OBS Studio. Vidlium software helps livestream directors manage guests in multiple video chats, personalize their guestâ€™s experiences, and control video feeds with advanced settings.

_Its fully browser based, uses vdo.ninja under the hood, and is open-source as well as completely free for everyone to use._

<br>

Check out some of the 'sister repos' of vidlium_director, you can find code for other parts of the website/software/system here:
- [Vidlium_Website (the core website)](https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/vidlium_website)
- [Vidlium_Docs](https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/vidlium_docs)


> The `Directors Page` is a critial page which allows directors to control a Vidlium Stream. This repository holds only the code for that page found here: https://vidlium.com/director.


## Usage

To start using Vidlium, the web version _(currently the only version)_ of the software is best. You can get started immediately at [vidlium.com](https://vidlium.com). The website provides access to the system as well as additional information on the code and how to do basic things via the [docs & guides](https://docs.vidlium.com).


## Development

Vidlium can be ran locally for developement purposes, although hosted locally, the system can still interact with streams created with the system hosted on vidlium.com.

Pre-requisites

To be able to start development on Vidlium make sure that you have the following pre-requisites installed:

###

- Node.js v16 or above
- Git

Starting Vidlium
</summary> <br />

###

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Andrew-Gallimore/vidlium_director.git && cd vidlium_director && npm install
```

2. Run the 'cert' script, which initiates creating SSL certificates for local domain names `test.vdo.ninja` and `teststatic.vdo.ninja`:
> 
```shell
npm run cert
```
> **Note:**
> When running `cert`, it may prompt you about needing to create a password. This is a password for the device's devcert Certificate Authority, which you will need to use if you are ever creating a new domain with devcert. In this case, you should only need to enter this once.
> 
> You only need to do this step initially after first downloading, only do step 3 for subsequent times when spinning up the dev server.

3. Run the 'start' script, which takes care of making a dev-build with gulp and creating a live reloading server for local hosting:
```shell
npm run start
```

The development environment should now be set up. 

- Navigate to [test.vdo.ninja/director](https://test.vdo.ninja/director) _(in chrome)_ for the directors-page with automatic reload for when you change code.

- Navigate to [teststatic.vdo.ninja:8443/director](https://teststatic.vdo.ninja:8443/director) _(also in chrome)_ for the directors page **without** automatic reload.

Additional information on the devcert, the system used for setting up the SSL and custom domains, can be found in [DEVCERT.md](devcert.md). Happy hacking! ðŸ‘¾
